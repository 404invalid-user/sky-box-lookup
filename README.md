# Sky Box Lookup Tool

A simple website you can use to look up the model of your Sky box based on your version number.
Just input your box's version number (go to Services > System Setup > System Details to find it) and the model of the box* should show up below

Version numbers sourced from https://settopbox.org/satellite/bskyb/sky-digital/receivers/sky-digibox-stb-versions/
^*A few models haven't been confirmed to match up to their version numbers.^
